# The W8UPD Django Site

This is the current production site, w8upd.org.

## Changes to pages of w8upd.org

You can make many changes to the content of the site through the django administration panel. This is *not* the place to make changes to most content. See if you can make changes in django first. If you have any questions ask! We will be happy to address them!

## To deploy

* ssh w8upd.org
* sudo /usr/local/bin/deploy-site-from-github
